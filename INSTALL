1.) Ensure the necessary applications are installed on your system. You'll need:

* Webserver (e.g. Apache 2)
* LDAP server (e.g. OpenLDAP 2)
* SQL server (e.g. MySQL 5)
* PHP5 with LDAP and MySQL support
* PEAR (see below for a list of packages required)

On a recent Debian system, install the following packages:

* apache2
* slapd
* ldap-utils
* mysql-server
* mysql-client
* php5-cgi
* php5-ldap
* php5-mysql
* php-pear

You might want to reconfigure web, LDAP and MySQL servers to only listen on
localhost, if you plan to use your Mango installation for development purposes
only.

Necessary PEAR packages are listed below (Fedora package names this time): 

* php-pear
* php-pear-Net-Socket
* php-pear-XML-Parser
* php-pear-Mail-Mime
* php-pear-XML-Util
* php-pear-Auth-SASL
* php-pear-Mail
* php-pear-HTML-Common
* php-pear-Net-SMTP


2.) Check out Mango sources, if you didn't already:

svn co http://svn.gnome.org/svn/mango/trunk mango


3.) Create a session directory

mkdir /where/you/checked/out/mango/sessions
chmod 777 /where/you/checked/out/mango/sessions

4.) Configure the LDAP server

The ldif files in the Mango docs directory assume that you use dc=example,dc=org
as the suffix for your LDAP directory. Start with editing the suffix variable and
all subsequent occurences of dc=nodomain in /etc/ldap/slapd.conf to say
"dc=example,dc=org" instead of "dc=nodomain".

Create a local administrator account to import the initial example LDAP data and
for later use with the Mango application. Insert into /etc/ldap/slapd.conf:

rootdn "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org"
rootpw {SSHA}B3MTCdJ+bDiAUUzMuhPzcrmKG33+8Wkj

You can generate a password string using the slappasswd utility.

The Mango application needs a number of custom LDAP schemas to work. Import all
schemas in docs/schemas by inserting into /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

# Mango schemas
include         /where/you/checked/out/mango/docs/schemas/cvs.schema
include         /where/you/checked/out/mango/docs/schemas/module.schema
inlcude         /where/you/checked/out/mango/docs/schemas/sshd.schema

In the future there might be even more custom schemas. Check the directory
docs/schemas and import all schemas you can find.

Restart slapd for the changes to take effect.


5.) Edit the example LDAP data to your liking

In docs/ldif is a ldif file that contains example LDAP data you can use for
your development installation of Mango. You might want to edit the data of the
example user to your liking. Check docs/ldif/ou.ldif for the following section:

# Initial User Account
dn: uid=bcicek,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
uid: bcicek
uidNumber: 6000
gidNumber: 6000
cn: Baris Cicek
sn: Baris Cicek
mail: baris@teamforce.name.tr
description: Mango Dev
loginShell: /bin/bash
homeDirectory: /home/directory
userPassword: e1NNRDV9aGV0QUdsdkZUdGtlSmM1YXpHQnFLRmMvY3NvPQ==

You might want to edit uid (in dn and uid attributes), cn, sn, mail and
userPassword. Again, use the slappasswd utility to generate the password string.

Now search for every occurence of the string bcicek and replace it with the user
id that you chose. If this works out, you will later be able to login using
the uid and password you chose and you will be the maintainer of the Mango
module. Congratulations ;).


6.) Import example LDAP data into the LDAP directory

You can use ldapadd to import example LDAP data (LDAP server should be running):

ldapadd -x -W -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org" -f docs/ldif/ou.ldif

Use the cn and password of the root account to import the data. If you encounter
errors (e.g. you made a mistake when editing the file) use the -c option in
subsequent imports to skip the objects already created.


7.) Configure MySQL server

Connect to the MySQL server using the mysql command line utility and create
a user and a database for Mango (in this case we used the name mango for both):

mysql -u root -p
> CREATE DATABASE mango;
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mango.* TO 'mango'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
> quit


8.) Import example MySQL data into database

In docs/sql are the sql files that contain the example sql data. Import these
files into the database you just created.

mysql -u root -p mango < /where/you/checked/out/mango/docs/sql/ftpmirrors.sql
mysql -u root -p mango < /where/you/checked/out/mango/docs/sql/foundationmembers.sql
mysql -u root -p mango < /where/you/checked/out/mango/docs/sql/mango.sql

There might be more sql files in the future. Check the docs/sql directory and
import all sql files you can find.

9.) Configure web server

Create a new entry in /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.123  mango.gnome.local

You can use whatever you want for the IP and hostname, as long as your web server
will respond to it. If you use Apache 2, add a virtualhost file in your Apache
sites dir (/etc/httpd/sites.d for RedHat, /etc/apache2/sites-available for
Debian/Ubuntu). In Debian/Ubuntu, create a symlink to your virtualhost file in
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled to enable the site. If you use the server only for
Mango development, you might want to remove the symlink for the default site.

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.123:80>
   ServerName mango.gnome.local
   DocumentRoot /where/you/checked/out/mango/www
   Options Includes ExecCGI
   AddHandler cgi-script .php
</VirtualHost>

Restart Apache for changes to take effect.


10.) Copy 'config-gnome.xml' to 'config.xml' and configure to taste. 

This is an overview about the configuration options:

* mode is either development, live or preview.
* base_url is the url of your web server
* secure_url is the same as base_url, just https (if you set that up).
* accounts_db_url, mirrors_db_url and membership_db_url is the url
  of your MySQl server (see step 7). The syntax is as follows:
  mysql://user:password@hostname:port/database
* smtp_url is the url of your smtp server
* ldap_url is the url of your ldap server
* ldap_binddn is your ldap root account (see step 4)
* ldap_bindpw is the password of your ldap root account (see step 4)
* ldap_usrs_basedn, ldap_groups_basedn, ldap_modules_basedn is where the
  user, groups and module data is stored in your ldap directory (see step 5)
* no idea what token_salt is, probably some kind of salt ;)
* support_email is the email address of your support team (probably your own)
* session_path is the path where sessions should be stored (see step 3)


11.) Connect to http://mango.gnome.local/ (or whatever you set it up to be)
and off you go. If everything worked, you should be able to login using the
example user you created earlier in step 6.
