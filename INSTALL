Roughly:

1) Set up the virtualhost

Create a new entry in /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.123  mango.gnome.local

You can use whatever you want for the IP and hostname, as long as Apache will respond to it. Next, add a virtualhost file in your Apache sites dir (/etc/httpd/sites.d for RedHat, /etc/apache/sites-available for Debian/Ubuntu).

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.123:80>
ServerName mango.gnome.local
DocumentRoot /where/you/checked/out/mango/www
</VirtualHost>

Restart Apache for changes to take effect.

2) Copy 'config-example.xml' to 'config.xml' and configure to taste. 

3) Connect to http://mango.gnome.local/ (or whatever you set it up to be) and off you go.
