Dear <member>,

We are pleased to inform you that your GNOME Foundation Membership has
been renewed for two years. You are eligible to become a candidate for
election and to vote in the annual Board of Directors elections held
each November. If you were not already subscribed to the
foundation-announce mailing list, you have been subscribed to this list,
where all the major GNOME Foundation announcements are sent. It is a low
volume list and does not allow subscribers to post emails. If you would
like to read the archives you can do so here:
    http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation-announce

You are also encouraged to subscribe to the foundation-list mailing
list. It is open to the public (even non-members) and is used to discuss
any issue relating to the GNOME Foundation. This is the place for you to
suggest ideas and voice your opinions on issues pertaining to the GNOME
Foundation. To subscribe or read the archives, go to:
    http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation-list

Sincerely,

The GNOME Foundation Membership Committee
